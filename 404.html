<h1>TikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social networking application.</h1>


The app itself is heavily monitored by the <b>Chinese Communist Party (CCP)</b>. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, device type and its specs, your interests, hobbies and current events in your life via OAuth background checks... well, they're using it.
<br>
<br>
By downloading TikTok onto your device, you have already given the following information to China:
<ul>
  <li>Phone hardware and certain software aspects (CPU type, hardware IDs, screen dimensions, DPI, memory usage, disk space, etc.)</li>
  <li>Other apps you have installed (This information is a cached value, meaning your list of apps installed is logged regardless if you delete an application from your device.)</li>
  <li>Whether or not your device is rooted / jailbroken</li>
  <li>Everything network related (IP address, local IP, MAC number, name of Wi-Fi access point)</li>
</ul>


Note: Some variants of the TikTok application had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every thirty seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever attach a location tag to a video you upload. They install a local proxy server on your device for "transcoding media", but said proxy server can be abused very easily as it has no authentication.
<br>
<br>
A question many TikTok users ask themselves is how the suggested page's (known via the app as For You Page, or FYP) mysterious "algorithm" works, and the answer is very simple. TikTok sorts its userbase in many different categories depending on interests, hobbies and other things a user enjoys. Whether it's hood videos, clips of animals doing cute things or maybe just videos by the fandoms of media you enjoy such as video games, anime and manga; TikTok can easily analyze users with similar apps installed as well as their interests and demographic. 
<br>
<br>
...but how do they get your interests and other information about yourself? Through linked accounts by corporations that also spy on their users.
<br>
<br>
If a user created their TikTok account by linking another service such as Facebook, Twitter or Google; the OAuth protocol performs a sort of background check without the user's knowledge. For example, it's no surprise that Google logs everything of little thing you do. They keep track of your search history across their platforms, and they already have your full name, birth date, gender, age and approximate location. TikTok accesses the search history which will most likely contain your interests and use that to bring you an abundance of videos that are recommended to users that also had their data analyzed; remember that TikTok keeps note of these users and sorts the users and the media they consume in categories. So if you just created an account and you're a fan of Genshin Impact (your Google/YouTube search history reflects this as well as having the app installed onto your device, which TikTok caught notice of), you're bound to recieve plenty of Genshin Impact related videos in your feed and other pieces of media related to the game such as anime. 
<br>
<br>
This also occurs with your IP address and the demographic TikTok sorts you with depending on information from OAuth, so that's why you'll come across a video or two consisting of something like "Only people from *your state/city* will understand!".
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, TikTok's vault of users' information is massive and could leak any day. Because of TikTok's close involvement with the Chinese Communist Party and the developers themselves residing in mainland China, everything TikTok has on its users, the Chinese government has as well. 
<br>
<br>
Why is this on a website related to Genshin Impact and some trend tied to the game itself? Because that game also falls victim of shitty security, censorship and extremely close ties to the CCP. Considering the majority of TikTok and Genshin Impact's userbase are children and they almost always flock to TikTok to hyperfixate on the game's characters, events and updates; it's quite scary.

<h1>Genshin Impact is another data collection service that is masqueraded as a harmless action video game.</h1>
The game in its very core is a Unity-built <b>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</b> clone, with anime men and women in place instead of elf-like characters and wide varieties of specimen, as well as gacha shoe-horned in as an easy way to make money from pedophiles who like anime girls a bit too much and children who don't know any better. It looks relatively harmless; but just like TikTok, the game is monitored by the CCP and collects personal data from its users as well. Also, a shit ton of elements that already have allowed kids to develop a gambling addiction because of fictional characters.
<br>
<br>
While the data collection isn't as huge as what TikTok's currently doing, it's something to keep note of; especially when combined with the developer miHoYo's security problems.
<br>
<br>
Upon downloading Genshin Impact on your device, the following data has already been collected and stored into miHoYo and the CCP's vault.
<ul>
  <li>Phone hardware and certain software aspects (CPU type, hardware IDs, screen dimensions, DPI, memory usage, disk space, etc.)</li>
  <li>Other apps you have installed (Also a cached value)</li>
  <li>Whether or not your device is rooted / jailbroken</li>
  <li>Everything network related (IP address, local IP, MAC number, name of Wi-Fi access point)</li>
</ul>
The developers also allow users to create accounts that can be linked to their Google, Facebook and Twitter accounts which just like TikTok; grants access to a very alarming amount of your personal data like your full name, birth date, gender, age and approximate location.
<br>
<br>
Their security is terrible, and even allowed people to view full phone numbers on the Genshin Impact website. If you entered a player's username and clicked "forgot password" password", their phone number would be showcased without any sort of censorship if the player inserted had linked their phone number upon account creation.
<br>
<br>
In other words, anyone could find out your phone number if they had access to your username.
